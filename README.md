<h2 My favorite Movie is  <h2>**A.I.: Artificial Intelligence** </h2> , The film depicts a possible future in which artificial intelligence approaches the realm of human emotions. A young boy/android is given to a couple whose own son was diagnosed with a condition that effectively ended his life. He has remained in stasis in the distant hope that a cure for what ails him will be discovered. David (Haley Joel Osmond) is created and programmed to show unconditional love before being given to the aforementioned couple. The father works for the company that created the android. David is brought to their home, and for the first time, his mother meets and sees him.He begins to wander through the night until he encounters Mecha (Jude Law), a streetwise android. They are apprehended in a hunt for stray robots/androids by a group that puts on shows about these creations, sort of like a circus that destroys mechanical beings in protest of how the world is turning away from humanity. But David is a one-of-a-kind creation. He has the ability to feel and express love, which no other robot has. The audience feels sorry for him and forces the show's producers to let him go. Mecha (Law) joins him.

### why AI,: Artificial Intelligence is my favorite:
A.I. is told almost like a fairy tale When Haley Joel Osment's robot David's human mother abandons him, he embarks on a quest to "become a real boy" so that she will finally love him back. The similarities to Pinocchio are undeniable, but it's the framing of the entire story as a fairy tale that emphasizes how emotionally unsettling the film's conclusion is.
